# KOFXIVDecomp
A decompilation project for The King of Fighters XIV. The basis was done using https://github.com/camden-smallwood/pdb-decompiler and IDA Pro. However, that is obviously not enough to get something functional. For example, template classes are broken, and most functions will not compile yet.

I recommend grabbing the EXE with the PDB file from http://debugging.games/, which will aid in understanding classes and structs. Note that this download does not include any assets or a cracked executable, so it will be unplayable without owning the Steam version of the game, only aiding in analysis.
